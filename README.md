# Sensors, Embedded Systems and Algorithms for Service Robotics - Lab Solutions

This repository contains the laboratory solutions for the **Sensors, Embedded Systems and Algorithms for Service Robotics** course at **Politecnico di Torino** (Academic Year 2025-2026).

The labs focus on practical implementation of robotics concepts using ROS 2, simulation tools, and real hardware.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **educational and reference purposes only**. The solutions provided are my own work.

## Lab Modules Overview

The course is divided into three main practical modules, each building upon the last.

### 1. ROS 2 Introduction Module

This module covers the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), from basic setup to creating a functional robot control package.
